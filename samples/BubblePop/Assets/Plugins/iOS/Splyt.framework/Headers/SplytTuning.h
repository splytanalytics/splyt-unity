 @brief Provides access to SPLYT's dynamic tuning variables.  
 @details Tuning variables are defined in SPLYT's web app and can have customized values on a per-user
          basis, depending on whether the active user of the app is participating in an A/B test, or 
          belongs to a segment of users that has been assigned customized values for one or more 
          tuning variables.
